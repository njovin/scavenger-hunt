## Welcome to GitHub Pages
In the office you will find your next clue is being protected by a circle of hands.

Hurry!  You'll have to check the back of Dad's truck before your next clue gets hauled away.

If a Kangaroo and Tigger lived at Jack's house where would they like to play?

Every day somebody in a blue shirt comes to Jack's house in a little white car. Maybe he left you something today.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/njovin/scavenger-hunt/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
